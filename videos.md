"Close-up with smooth camera movement: A tiger cub sits in a picturesque green meadow, surrounded by gently fluttering butterflies. The camera tracks one butterfly as it slowly flies towards the cub and delicately lands on its nose.
The tiger cub looks at it with a curious and surprised expression, slightly twitching its ears. Real-time action: Every movement of the butterfly and the cub's reaction happens smoothly and naturally, creating a lifelike moment.
Lighting: Soft daylight enhances the scene's realism, highlighting intricate details like the cub’s fur texture and the butterfly’s wings. Camera: Shot on a full-frame (A7S3) with a 35mm lens, ensuring cinematic sharpness and depth."
